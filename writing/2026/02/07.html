Hi!  It's been a while.
</p>
I'm going to make this entry a draft email to
<a href="mailto:theantialienationproject@gmail.com">theantialienationproject@gmail.com</a>
about my relationship with my daughter (and probably also a bit about my relationship with her mom and my understanding of her 
relationship with her mom).

Hi Madi,
</p>
<p>
I'm writing because I want to document for myself where things are right now for me, to help me clear my head a bit, and I'm
sharing it with you in case you find it interesting or useful in any way.  Also, thank you for all that you do in helping people
like me better understand that they're not alone and that the world is filled with many complicated and distinct father-daughter
relationships.
