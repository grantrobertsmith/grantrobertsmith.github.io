Hi!  It's been a while.
</p>
I'm going to make this entry a draft email to
<a href="mailto:theantialienationproject@gmail.com">theantialienationproject@gmail.com</a>
about my relationship with my daughter (and probably also a bit about my relationship with her mom and my understanding of her 
relationship with her mom).
<p>

Hi Madi,
</p>
<p>
I'm writing because I want to document for myself where things are right now for me, to help me clear my head a bit, and I'm
sharing it with you in case you find it interesting or useful in any way.  Also, thank you for all that you do in helping people
like me better understand that they're not alone and that the world is filled with many complicated and distinct father-daughter
relationships.
</p>
<p>
I'm 37; my daughter is almost 13.  After spending ~6 years visiting her where she lives, first for just one day a month and then
slowly increasing over the years up to ~1 week per month (but her mom wouldn't allow her to sleep over every, so just during the
days), I moved to be closer to her when she was 10.  I was hoping that having my own apartment where my daughter could have her
own bedroom would make it so that she'd be allowed to sleep over if she wanted; it did not.  As I recall it, her mom and I
eventually got into an arguement about my daughter staying over for the night at my place where her mom kept claiming that our
daughter didn't want to sleep over. Eventually, she said something along the lines of "Even if she did, I'm her mom and I get to
make that decision."
</p>
<p>
Among other issues with the situation at that time, this disagreement ultimately prompted me to push put more formal structure
in place around our interactions.  This had many tradeoffs, but I think the real breakdown in healthy parenting and effective
communication started happening a couple years prior to that incident.  I'm going to break my thoughts here because this is
getting way to into details for myself... jumping to the present moment, while I am able to have time with my daughter, she
basically doesn't want to have a relationship with me.  She would rather if she could just operate in her mom's world, pretend
that I basically don't exist, and she already basically thinks of her mom's new family with her half sister and stepdad as her
one and only real family.  Even though I believe that deep down I still matter to her, I know that she doesn't see it that way
herself, which can be very difficult at times (for either/both of us).
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I'm just doing my best here, and I guess now that I've written all this, I would also like to ask if there's anything
you might be able to suggest to me that I'm missing.  Specifically, do you know of any support groups for parents who are
working though this type of challeng in the moment?  If not, maybe I should try to start one and let you know how it goes.
</p>
<p>
My sincere thanks, best regards and well wishes for your project's good fortune,
</p>
<p>
